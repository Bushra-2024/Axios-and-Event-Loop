# What is Axios?

Axios is a library that makes it simple to send HTTP requests from a browser or a Node.js environment. It's like the built-in fetch API, but with extra features that make it more powerful and easier to use.


### Why use Axios?

1. **Simpler Syntax**: Axios automatically formats the request and handles common tasks like JSON parsing.
2. **Node.js and Browser Support**: Works seamlessly in both environments.
3. **Automatic JSON Handling**: Parses JSON responses and converts request data to JSON if needed.
4. **Built-in Features**: Includes request cancellation, timeout settings, and response interceptors.
